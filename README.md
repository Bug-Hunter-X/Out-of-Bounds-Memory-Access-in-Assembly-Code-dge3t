This repository demonstrates an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability in assembly code and its solution. The vulnerability arises from the lack of bounds checking when accessing an array. The provided assembly code attempts to access memory beyond the allocated space for the array, resulting in unpredictable behavior, such as crashes or data corruption. The solution addresses this issue by implementing robust bounds checking to prevent memory access violations.
